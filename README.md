# AssaultCubeNoob
AssaultCubeNoob is a simple aimbot for Assault Cube written in C, and features a minimal codebase. It works by walking the entity list and checking if the entity is currently on screen and above 0 hitpoints. 

Usage:  
- Inject into `ac_client.exe` process, press F1 on the console window to enable/disable aimbotting, or F2 for no-recoil.  
- When another player is on your screen, your aim will seek close to their head.  

Thanks for taking a look, updates will be made slowly when I have time.
