# AssaultCubeNoob
AssaultCubeNoob is a simple aimbot for Assault Cube written in C, and features a minimal codebase. It works by walking the entity list and checking if the entity is currently on screen and above 0 hitpoints. It was made as a test to see how quickly and easily cheats can be made for a typical FPS game, and took around 2 or 3 hours total.

Usage:  
- Inject into `ac_client.exe` process, press F1 on the console window to enable/disable aimbotting, or F2 for no-recoil.  
- When another player is on your screen, your aim will seek close to their head.  

Remember, cheating in online FPS games is for n00bs and I don't advise it, only the worst players use cheats.

Thanks for taking a look!
