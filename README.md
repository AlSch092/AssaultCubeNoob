# AssaultCubeNoob
AssaultCubeNoob is a simple aimbot for Assault Cube written in C, and features a minimal codebase. 

Usage:  
- Inject into `ac_client.exe` process, press F1 on the console window to enable/disable aimbotting, F2 for no-recoil.  
- When another player is on your screen, your aim will seek close to their head.  

Thanks for taking a look, updates will be made slowly when I have time.
